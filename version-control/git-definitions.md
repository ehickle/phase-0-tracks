# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the practice of keeping a record of all changes, additions, and edits to a software project. Git and GitHub are commonly used tools for version control, with GitHub allowing for the additional perk of sharing a proect across several machines and developers. Version control not only provides accountability, but it also allows for new versions and features to be developed without affecting the current version of a project. It's helpful in identifying when bugs were introduced and working in collaboration. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the main code. A branch can be edited without changing the main portion of the project. Using branches allows you to develop new code without the danger of messing up currently existing code. It also allows other team members to review your code before it is implemented.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a saved version of your code in a git repository. A good commit message describes what was changed or added to the code; a more specific message is more helpful to other team members.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two versions of the file provide conflicting information. This is most common when two people edit the same lines of code in one file, and attempt to merge them.
