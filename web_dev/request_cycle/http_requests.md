1. Common HTTP status codes
    -200: success
    -404: not found.
    -403: forbidden. Commonly seen with web blockers.
    -204 No content
    -304 not modified

2. Get vs. Post
    The largest difference between GET and POST is that the POST method allows the browser to submit data to be processed by the web server. Additionally, POST requests are not cached and have no data length limits.

3. Cookies are small files created by a web browser which contain user information. Since servers do not have memory, the browser must send the cookie containing user data in forder to personalize a website. Cookies can be temporary (deleted when a browser is closed) or persistent (stored permanently in memory until expiration).
