1. Key design philosophies of linux system
    -The linux system was built for users who already had a knowledge of computers, and could therefore manipulate the system freely. Linux does not hide the technical end of the computer from users like Mac or Windows. Further, Linux was developed to allow a user to have complete control without needing to confirm every command.

2. a VPS operates like a traditional physical server, however, it does not have physical hardware. A VPS is a piece of memory on a remote computer that is able to run operating systems independently and be accessed from another machine.

One of the largest benefits of VPS hosting is that the server is easily scalable. FOr instance, if a business originally only needs to store data for 100 customers, but then the business grows quickly, it is very easy to purchase more server resources to expand the database. VPS is also typically cheaper than using physical servers.

3. Aloowing use and login by the root user can be a security threat. If you are able to directly log in as the root user, malicious software could login from anywhere simply by acquiring your password. Adding log in for a unique user adds another level of security.
